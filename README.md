# IISER Internship Project

üîó **Live Demo:** [View Project Page](https://abhishek-maurya-d.github.io/IISER-Internship/)

This repository contains the work undertaken during an internship at the Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research (IISER). The project focuses on quantum network simulations and includes both theoretical documentation and practical implementations.

## Weekly Work Breakdown

### Week 1 ‚Äî QuNetSim Implementation

- `QuNetSim.py` ‚Äî Python script implementing quantum network simulations using the QuNetSim framework.
- `QuNetSim Theory.docx` ‚Äî A comprehensive document detailing the theoretical aspects of quantum networking and the QuNetSim simulator.

### Week 2 ‚Äî Web Interface Development

- `index.html` ‚Äî The main HTML file for the web interface of the simulation project.
- `script.ts` ‚Äî TypeScript file containing the logic and interactivity for the web interface.
- `styles.css` ‚Äî CSS file for styling the web interface.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python** ‚Äî For backend simulations and quantum network modeling.
- **HTML/CSS** ‚Äî To structure and style the web interface.
- **TypeScript** ‚Äî For adding interactivity and handling user actions in the frontend.

## üìö Project Overview

The project simulates quantum networks using the [QuNetSim](https://github.com/tqsd/QuNetSim) framework. It provides both:
- a backend for simulating quantum communication protocols, and
- a frontend interface for user interaction and visualization.

The theoretical documentation explains the foundational principles of quantum networking used in the simulations.
